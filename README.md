# zkSNARK-circomCIRCUIT-VerifyProof-
This Project Walks You Through How To Code Different Circuit In circom Program And How To Deploy An Verifier To TestNet like [MumbaiPolygon](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) And Generate Any Proof Of Specefic Inputs And Verify Using Verfier                                                                       

## Description
This Project Includes All The Resources That You Needed To Get Started With circom Program for Coding on zkSNARK Circuits                                                 
First You Need To Know A Little About Circuit Gates These Are The Some Details About Basic Gates Which Includes OR,AND,NOT That You Need To Get Started :                
 1.AND Gate(andGate):An And Gate Takes In Two Inputs(A,B) And Returns Output(X) Based On The Below Logic:                                                                
   A and  B ==> X                                                                                                                                                        
   1 and  0 ==> 0                                                                                                                                                        
   1 and  1 ==> 1

These Three Gates Will Be We Using For This Project                                                                                                                        

## Getting Started
For Getting Fired Up You Need To Setup Your Compiler With Necesary Files:                                                                                                  
*As For IDE You Can Use Offline IDE Like[Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Or You Can Use Online IDE Like [REmix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)Or[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)                                                                                                                                                                  
*Next You Need To Install Necessary Dependencies                                                                                                                                 
 Hardhat:[install](https://hardhat.org/)
 nodeJs:[install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)                                                                                                                           
*Now You Can Design Your On circuit Using Different Types OF Gates Template Provided [HERE!](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib)                                                
*Now You Are Set To GO!!!!!                                                                                                                                                  
### Installing

* Now You Need To Install The Project Template Circuit Files By Cloning This Reprository
* Or If You Need To Start With Fresh You Can Use [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/gmchad/zardkat) here
* After That You Need To Add env File For Making Your Private Keys Secure You Can Install By Going  [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* Next You Need To Setup Your Testnet Details In circuits.config.json By Going To [HardhatNetwork](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/deploying-to-a-live-network)
