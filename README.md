## Description
This Project Includes All The Resources That You Needed To Get Started With circom Program for Coding on zkSNARK Circuits                                                 
First You Need To Know A Little About Circuit Gates These Are The Some Details About Basic Gates Which Includes OR,AND,NOT That You Need To Get Started :                
 1.AND Gate(andGate):An And Gate Takes In Two Inputs(A,B) And Returns Output(X) Based On The Below Logic:                                                                
 
   A and  B ==> X                                                                                                                                                        
   1 and  0 ==> 0                                                                                                                                                        
   1 and  1 ==> 1                                                                                                                                                        
   0 and  0 ==> 0

   0 ==> 1                                                                                                                                                                

3.OR Gate(orGate):An And Gate Takes In Two Inputs(A,B) And Returns Output(x) Based On The Below Logic:                                                                    
 
   A  or  B ==> X

These Three Gates Will Be We Using For This Project:                                                                                                                       ![Circuit Diagram](https://authoring.metacrafters.io/assets/cms/Assessment_b05f6ed658.png?updated_at=2023-02-24T00:00:37.278Z) 

**CircuitTemplates**

For Creating Each Gates Of This Circuit We Are Using PreMade Template By [circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib)

**This Will Be The Code For Particular Circuit**
```
pragma circom 2.0.0;

/*This circuit Takes Two Inputs(a,b) And Give Specefic Output(q)*/  

template Multiplier2 () {  

   //Declare Your Input 
      signal input a;
      signal input b;


  //Declare Your Signal
      signal x;
      signal y;


  //Declare Your Output
      signal output q;


  //Declare Your Gate
      component andGate = AND();
      component notGate = NOT();
      component orGate = OR();


  //Logic Of Your Circuit

  //Inputs
      andGate.a <== a;
      andGate.b <== b;
      notGate.in <== b;
  // Declare Signals

      x <== andGate.out;
      y <== notGate.out;
  //Declare OrGate Inputs

      orGate.a <== x;
      orGate.b <== y;

  //Output

      q <== orGate.out;

   
}
template AND() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output out;

    out <== a*b;
}
template OR() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output out;

    out <== a + b - a*b;
}

template NOT() {
    signal input in;
    signal output out;

    out <== 1 + in - 2*in;
}

component main = Multiplier2();
```

## Getting Started
For Getting Fired Up You Need To Setup Your Compiler With Necesary Files:                                                                                                 


* As For IDE You Can Use Offline IDE Like[Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Or You Can Use Online IDE Like [REmix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)Or[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

            
* Next You Need To Install Necessary Dependencies:

        
   Hardhat:[install](https://hardhat.org/)
 
   nodeJs:[install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)                                                                                                                 

 
* Now You Can Design Your On circuit Using Different Types OF Gates Template Provided [HERE!](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib)

         
* Now You Are Set To GO!!!!!                                                                                                                                                  
### Installing

* Now You Need To Install The Project Template Circuit Files By Cloning This Reprository
  
* Or If You Need To Start With Fresh You Can Use [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/gmchad/zardkat) here

* After That You Need To Add env File For Making Your Private Keys Secure You Can Install By Going  [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
  
* Next You Need To Setup Your Testnet Details In circuits.config.json By Going To [HardhatNetwork](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/deploying-to-a-live-network)

* Now You Need Some Test MATIC On Your Wallet If You Dont You Can It For Free From [Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-mumbai) here

* You Need To Paste Your `PRIVATE KEY` In .env.example File **PRIVATE_KEY='Your Key Here'**

* Now Lets Run The Program 
### Executing program

* First install All npm Dependencies By Running:
  
```
npm i
```
* Next Lets Compile Our Cicuit By Typing:
  
```
npx hardhat circom
```
This will generate the **out** file with circuit intermediaries and geneate the **MultiplierVerifier.sol** contract

* Next We Need To Give The Input For (a,b) For the And Gate For That Just Go To input.json :

```
{
  "a": "0",
  "b": "1"
}
```
This will Be The Input Data While We Generate Our Proof

* Finally We Will Deploy Our Verifier To PolygonMumbai Testnet And Verify Our Proof By:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```
This script does 4 things  
1. Deploys the MultiplierVerifier.sol contract Into PolygonMumbai Testnet
2. Generates a proof from circuit intermediaries with `generateProof()` With Input(0,1)
3. Generates calldata with `generateCallData()`
4. Calls `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with calldata

With two commands you can compile a ZKP, generate a proof, deploy a verifier, and verify the proof 🎉

You Can Check Your Verifier Contract Creation In [PolygonMumbai Scanio](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) By Pasting Your Contract ID

### Directory Structure
**circuits**
```
├── multiplier
│   ├── circuit.circom
│   ├── input.json
│   └── out
│       ├── circuit.wasm
│       ├── multiplier.r1cs
│       ├── multiplier.vkey
│       └── multiplier.zkey
├── new-circuit
└── powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau
```
Each new circuit lives in it's own directory. At the top level of each circuit directory lives the circom circuit and input to the circuit.
The **out** directory will be autogenerated and store the compiled outputs, keys, and proofs. The Powers of Tau file comes from the Polygon Hermez ceremony, which saves time by not needing a new ceremony. 


**contracts**
```
contracts
└── MultiplierVerifier.sol
```
Verifier contracts are autogenerated and prefixed by the circuit name, in this example **Multiplier**
## Help
This Is Just An Two Command Project So There Is No Way You Gonna Face Any issues
But You May Encounter ERror Due To Your Wrong Syntax In Circom Programming So Make Sure To Do Your Syntax Correctly
If You Get Stuck At SomeWhere Or Facing Some Error Or Issue Feel Free To Contact Me On Email I Will Be More Than Happt Help YOu.
